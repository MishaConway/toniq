Toniq
=======

Simple and reliable background job library for [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/).

Just like [Phoenix](http://www.phoenixframework.org/), this library does not make you choose between productivity and speed.

Designed to:

* Be very easy to use. Just define a worker and enqueue jobs!
* Pass arguments to the worker exactly as they where enqueued, no JSON conversion
* Play to Erlang's strengths
  - One job is one Erlang process
  - 100k concurrent processes on one computer is not unusual
* Automatically retry jobs that fail
* Limit concurrency when requested
* Skip persistence when requested
* Notify about errors through [Logger](http://elixir-lang.org/docs/v1.0/logger/Logger.html)
  - Can be passed on to services like [honeybadger](https://github.com/joakimk/honeybadger)
* Use redis sparingly
  - To handle Erlang VM restarts and crashes without loosing jobs
  - To record failed jobs and be able to do manual retries or deletion
  - To be able to see status (iex for now, possible UI in the future)
* Fail on the side of running a job too many times rather than not at all. See more on this below.
* Work well on limited environments like Heroku where you can't connect multiple erlang nodes directly or do hot code updates
* Have helpful error messages

Uses redis to persist jobs but is **not** resque/sidekiq compatible. If you need that then I'd recommend you look at [Exq](https://github.com/akira/exq). You can run both Exq and Toniq in the same app for different workers.

If **anything is unclear** about how this library works or what an error message means **that's considered a bug**, please file an issue (or a pull request)!

## Usage

Define a worker:

```elixir
defmodule SendEmailWorker do
  use Toniq.Worker

  def perform(to: to, subject: subject, body: body) do
    # do work
  end
end
```

Enqueue jobs somewhere in your app code:

```elixir
Toniq.enqueue(SendEmailWorker, to: "info@example.com", subject: "Hello", body: "Hello, there!")
```

## Pipelines

You can also enqueue jobs using |> like this:


```elixir
email = [to: "info@example.com", subject: "Hello", body: "Hello, there!"]

email
|> Toniq.enqueue_to(SendEmailWorker)
```

## Pattern matching

You can pattern match in workers. This can be used to clean up the code, or to handle data from previous versions of the same worker!

```elixir
defmodule SendMessageWorker do
  use Toniq.Worker

  def perform(message: "", receipient: _receipient) do
    # don't send empty messages
  end

  def perform(message: message, receipient: receipient) do
    SomeMessageService.send(message, receipient)
  end
end
```

## Limiting concurrency

For some workers you might want to limit the number of jobs that run at the same time. For example, if you call out to a API, you most likely don't want more than 3-10 connections at once.

You can set this by specifying the `max_concurrency` option on a worker.

```elixir
defmodule RegisterInvoiceWorker do
  use Toniq.Worker, max_concurrency: 10

  def perform(invoice_attributes) do
    # do work
  end
end
```

## Skipping persistence

For jobs where speed is important and it does not matter if it's lost on app server restart.

As an example, say you wanted to record page hits in redis. By doing so in a background job, you would not only respond quicker to the web request, but also handle temporary connection errors.

You can set this by specifying the `persist` option on a worker.

```elixir
defmodule RecordPageHitWorker do
  use Toniq.Worker, persist: false

  def perform do
    # do work
  end
end
```

And in the web request run:

```elixir
Toniq.enqueue(RecordPageHitWorker)
```

Or you could specify it for induvidual enqueue's:

```elixir
Toniq.enqueue(SendEmailWorker, [subject: "5 minute reminder!", to: "..."], persist: false)
```

## FAQ

### Why have a job queue at all?

* You don't have to run the code syncronously. E.g. don't delay a web response while sending email.
* You don't have to write custom code for the things a job queue can handle for you.
* You get persistence, retries, failover, concurrency limits, etc.

### Will jobs be run in order?

This is a first-in-first-out queue but due to retries and concurrency, ordering can not be guaranteed.

### How are jobs serialized when stored in redis?

Jobs are serialized using erlang serialization. This means you can pass almost anything to jobs, but just passing basic types is probably a good idea for compatibility with future code changes

### If an Erlang VM stops and not all jobs are processed, how are those jobs handled?

As soon as another Erlang VM is running it will find the jobs in redis, move them into it's own queue and run them. It may take a little while before this happens (10-15 seconds or so), so that the original VM has a chance to report in and retain it's jobs.

Toniq does not use any locks in redis. The takeover is the only point where multiple VMs contest for the same data and it's handled with a redis transaction. The jobs are either moved over or nothing happens if it's already moved by another VM.

The failover system consists of three independent processes:

* `Toniq.Keepalive` reports in as long as the VM is running and redis is available
* `Toniq.Takeover` takes over jobs from vms that hasn't reported in recently enough
* `Toniq.JobImporter` enqueues and runs inherited jobs

The default timeouts and intervals should work for most people, but you can customize them for your application, see [config.ex](lib/toniq/config.ex) for defaults.

### Why will jobs be run more than once in rare cases?

If something really unexpected happens and a job can't be marked as finished after being run, this library prefers to run it twice (or more) rather than not at all.

Unexpected things include something killing the erlang VM, an unexpected crash within the job runner, or problems with the redis connection at the wrong time.

You can solve this in two ways:
* Go with the flow: make your jobs runnable more than once without any bad sideeffects. Also known as [Reentrancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reentrancy_(computing)).
* Implement your own locking, or contribute some such thing to this library.

I tend to prefer the first alternative in whenever possible.

## TODO

### Safety and reliability

* [ ] Retry connecting to redis for at least 15 seconds before crashing toniq
* Retries
  - [ ] A failed job will be automatically retried with a delay between each.
  - [ ] A failed job can be manually retried and/or deleted by running code in an iex prompt.

### Speed

* [ ] Custom and infinite max\_concurrency
  - Probably only enforced on a VM-level. Two vms of max\_concurrency 10 can run 20 concurrent jobs. Document how it works.
  - Idea: use GenEvent of finished/failed to drive it?
* [ ] Be able to skip persistence
* [ ] Simple benchmark to see if it behaves as expected in different modes

### 1.0

* [ ] Add CI
* [ ] Update README to reflect what exists and remove readme-driven-development tag.
* [ ] Remove all old todos from the readme.
* [ ] See if it makes sense to store the reason for a failed job before 1.0 (e.g. changes in persistence format)
* [ ] Review persistence format. Will have to write migrations after 1.0.
* [ ] Review the data available to the worker. Would it make sense to make the id available? Maybe to be able to do serial jobs? Would only exist for persisted jobs?
* [ ] Make a note about API stability and semver
* [ ] Hex package
* [ ] Add installation instructions
  - Make a note about multiple apps using the same redis server and the config for that.
* [ ] MAYBE: Better error for arity bugs on `perform` since that will be common. Lists need to be ordered, if it's a list, make the user aware of that, etc.

### Later

* [ ] More logging
* [ ] Consider starting toniq differently in tests to better isolate unit tests
* [ ] Be able to run without any persistence if none is needed?
* [ ] A failed job can be automatically retried a configurable number of times with exponential backoff.
* [ ] Support different enqueue strategies on a per-worker or per-enqueue basis
  - [ ] Delayed persistence: faster. Run the job right away, and persist the job at the same time. You're likely going to have a list of jobs to resume later if the VM is stopped.
  - [ ] No persistence: fastest. Run the job right away. If the VM is stopped jobs may be lost.
* [ ] Add timeouts for jobs (if anyone needs it). Should be fairly easy.
* [ ] Admin UI
  - [ ] That shows waiting and failed jobs
  - [ ] Make data easiliy available for display in the app that uses toniq
  - [ ] Store/show time of creation
  - [ ] Store/show retry count
* [ ] Look into cleaning up code using [exactor](https://github.com/sasa1977/exactor)

### Notes

I'm trying to follow the default elixir style when writing elixir. That means less space between things, like `["foo"]` instead of `[ "foo" ]` like I write most other code. Because of this, spacing may be a bit inconsistent.

## Credits

- The name toniq was thought up by [Henrik Nyh](https://github.com/henrik). The idea was synonym of elixir with a q for queue.
- [Lennart Frid√©n](https://github.com/devl) helped out with building the failover system during his [journeyman-tour](http://codecoupled.org/journeyman-tour/) visit to our office
